# MYOB Quorum Review - Language Design Problems
This repository holds my application that I will be using for my first Quorem Review (MYOB). This application aims demonstrate my knowledge and illustrate the concepts I have learned throughout my experience in the Future Makers Academy - Acceleration Phase so far.

This console-based application is inspired by the [Mars Rover Kata](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/main/katas/kata-mars-rover/kata-mars-rover.md) - it provides an interface for a user to interact with a rover and naivgate it around on a grid. 

The programming language used in this project:
- C#

## Setup and Installation
Install Git if you do not have it already. Refer to [Git Install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). You can can check your Git version by typing the following in the terminal:
```
git --version
```

You will need to have an Intergrated Development Environment (IDE). Here are some recommended IDEs:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (You will need the extension: C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp))
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)


To setup this project, first select or create a directory you want to house this project within.

Enter the following terminal command to clone the source repository from GitHub into your selected directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/mwGHburger/MarsRoverQuorem1.git
```

Move into the project folder using the terminal command:
```
cd MarsRover
```

Run the application using the terminal command:
```
dotnet run
```
