# MYOB Quorem Review - Language Design Problems
This repository holds my application that I will be using for my first Quorem Review (MYOB). This application aims demonstrate my knowledge and illustrate the concepts I have learned throughout my experience in the Future Makers Academy - Acceleration Phase so far.

This console-based application is inspired by the [Mars Rover Kata](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/main/katas/kata-mars-rover/kata-mars-rover.md) - it provides an interface for a user to interact with a rover and naivgate it around on a grid. 

The programming language used in this project:
- C#
